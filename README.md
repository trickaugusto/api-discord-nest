# Morning 2024!
Building readme.......

This repo is an API about a project that I'm building in public. I will make some posts on my [dev.to](https://dev.to/trickaugusto) about my journey.

## I abandoned the project
This project was abandoned because I'm not interested in it anymore. 
But, I will keep here. Maybe I will use it in the future.

This project learned me a lot of things. I learned about:
- Jest 
- Testing with TDD
- Node.js
- Husky
- Lint-staged

And with this knowledge was used in my job. So, I'm happy with the result. Ty =)
