# Morning 2024!
Building readme.......

This repo is an API about a project that I'm building in public. I will make some posts on my [dev.to](https://dev.to/trickaugusto) about my journey.

## I abandoned the project
This project has been abandoned because I'm no longer interested in it. But I'm going to stay here. Maybe I'll use it in the future.

This project has taught me many things. I've learned about:

- Jest
- Testing with TDD
- Node.js
- Husky
- Staging

And with this knowledge I used it in my work. So I'm happy with the result. Ty =)
